            In the field of Data Science and Analytics, both accumulation and
            interpretation of data plays an important role. Mastering these two
            diverse domains is what makes an excellent "Data Scientist".
            It needs expertise in both Statistical Analysis and Computer Automation.

            A quality time of the researcher is spent in mining through the data,
            cleaning, imputing and understanding them. Most of these statistical
            analysis are highly contextual and is usually
            tackled by isolating portions the problem. From a computer science prospective
            if the problem is understood there is always a potential way to automate
            it and make similar experiments reproducible.
